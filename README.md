## Structure

The code is largely undocumented and copied verbatim from the original SVN code tree. You may notice that some modules are JavaScript are in compiled format. These modules used to be automatically transpiled from our original web application security scanning engine written in Java. This engine is also now open-sourced.

## Purpose

This code is now absolute and unmaintained. Websecurify will be making additional work in this space with our next generation web application security scanner.
